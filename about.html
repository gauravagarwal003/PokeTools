    <h1>About Us</h1>
  </div>

  <div id="about-us">
<p>
  Hi, I'm Gaurav, a longtime Pokémon TCG fan and software developer based in the US. Like many collectors, I've spent
  countless hours chasing vending machines. After getting tired of piecing together scattered information, I built
  something to make it easier — and that's how <strong>PokeTools</strong> started.
</p>

<p>
  PokeTools is a set of free tools for the Pokémon TCG community. Every day, it checks official Pokémon Center vending
  machine listings, finds new locations, and maps them so you can skip the endless searching. It also tracks price trends to help you spot opportunities and make smarter collecting choices. The data updates daily, so what
  you see is always current.
</p>

<p>
  My goal is simple: make Pokémon collecting easier, faster, and more fun. Whether you're trying to find a vending
  machine near you or find the best bang for your buck set, PokeTools helps you spend less time searching and more time
  enjoying the hobby.
</p>

<p>
  I'm always open to feedback, ideas, or collaborations. You can email me at
  <a href="mailto:poketools3@gmail.com">poketools3@gmail.com</a> or
  <span style="cursor: pointer; text-decoration: underline; color: blue" onclick="displayContactForm()">use this form</span>.
  If you've found PokeTools helpful and want to support the project, you can
  <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/gprojects" target="_blank" rel="noopener">buy me a coffee ☕</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Thanks for stopping by, and happy collecting!

    <h1>About the Tools</h1>
    <h3>Vending Machine Locations</h3>
    <p>This tool shows the locations of offical Pokemon Center Vending Machines in the USA on a map. It is updated daily
      from
      the Pokemon Center website.</p>
    <p>These machines are usually placed in grocery stores and sell TCG products at MSRP! Also, <a
        href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/pokemon-card-scalpers-vending-machines/">new measures</a> mean
      it's more likely for non-scalpers to get product!</p>
    <h3>Set Prices & EV</h3>
    <p>This tool shows the current and historical data for these three values:</p>
    <p><strong>Expected Value (EV):</strong> The expected value of a pack, calculated by weighting each card's market
      value by its chance of being pulled.</p>
    <p><strong>Pack Price:</strong> The current market price of a pack.</p>
    <p><strong>Percent Recovered:</strong> How much you'd expect to recover in value if you bought the pack at market
      price.</p>
    <p>These values are updated daily. Note: Shrouded Fable is not included as TCGplayer Infinite did not release pull
      rates for it.</p>
